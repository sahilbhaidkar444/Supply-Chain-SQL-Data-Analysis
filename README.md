# Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains the following tables:<br>
**products**: contains information about the products, such as product name, price, and SKU.<br><br>
**inventory**: contains information about the inventory levels for each product, such as the current quantity and reorder point.<br><br>
**vendors**: contains information about the vendors, such as vendor name, address, and contact information.<br><br>
**orders**: contains information about the orders, such as the order ID, order date, and vendor ID.<br><br>
**items**: contains information about the items ordered, such as the order ID, product ID, quantity, and unit price.<br><br>

# Analysis Questions
The following analysis questions were explored in this project:<br><br>
- **Basic Level Analysis Questions :**<br>
1. How many products does the company sell?<br>
2. What are the names of the products and their corresponding SKUs?<br>
3. What is the price of each product?<br>
4. How much inventory does the company have for each product?<br>
5. What is the reorder point for each product?<br>
6. How many vendors does the company have?<br>
7. How many orders has the company received?<br>

- **Intermediate Level Analysis Questions:**
1. Which product has the highest price and what is the price?<br>
2. What is the average price of all the products?<br>
3. Which product has the highest revenue?<br>
4. What is the total revenue generated from all the orders?<br>
5. What is the revenue generated by each vendor?<br>
6. What is the total quantity of each product sold?<br>
7. Which product has the maximum quantity sold?<br>
8. What is the average quantity of each product sold per order?<br>
9. What is the average unit price of each product sold per order?<br>

# Conclusion
By answering the above analysis questions using SQL queries, we can gain insights into the company's supply chain and make data-driven decisions. This project demonstrates my SQL skills and ability to perform data analysis using SQL queries.
